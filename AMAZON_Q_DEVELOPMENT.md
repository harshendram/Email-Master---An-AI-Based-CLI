## 📽️ **See My Development in Action**

I've documented parts of my build process through short videos:

🔗 **Video 1:** [Initial CLI Architecture & OAuth Flow](#your-link-here)
🔗 **Video 2:** [Final AI-Powered Email Analysis & Dashboard Demo](#your-link-here)

I forgot to record videos in between as i tweaked many features.....

## 📝 **Project Background**

For the **AWS Q Developer Challenge #1**, I built `EmailMaster CLI`, a modern, AI-enhanced command-line tool to:

- **Fetch Gmail emails**
- **Analyze them with Gemini AI**
- **Classify priorities, generate summaries, suggest actions**
- **Provide a dashboard-like CLI experience for developers**

Inspired by Amazon's modern CLI tools (AWS CLI, Amazon Q CLI), this project bridges **AI email productivity** and **developer ergonomics**.

## 🛠️ **How I Used Amazon Q Developer in My Workflow**

### 🔹 **Project Ideation & Architecture**

- Structured commands (`fetch`, `analyze`, `dashboard`, `reply`, etc.) inspired by modern CLI standards.
- Used Q Developer to validate CLI flows, OAuth strategies, and UX decisions.

### 🔹 **Problem-Solving with Q Developer**

Throughout development, Q Developer provided precise guidance:

| ⚠️ Problem                               | 💡 How Q Developer Helped                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| OAuth complexities (tokens, expirations) | Explained flows, suggested CLI UX for auth prompts        |
| CLI UX inconsistencies                   | Helped refine outputs, help commands, ASCII banners       |
| API batching for Gemini limits           | Suggested batching patterns to avoid quota issues         |
| Multi-account support for Gmail          | Guided restructuring account management cleanly           |
| Modern terminal output (ASCII + Colors)  | Recommended better libraries (chalk over gradient-string) |
| Clarifying OAuth URL handling            | Suggested auto-redirect vs manual copy-paste patterns     |

### 🔹 **Iterating Faster, Smarter**

I treated Amazon Q Developer as my AI **co-pilot** for:

- Debugging error flows
- Re-structuring account management
- Designing user-friendly CLI outputs
- Maintaining a modern DX (Developer Experience) throughout

## 💭 **Final Reflection: Why Q Developer Made This Possible**

Amazon Q Developer didn't just assist my coding — it enhanced how I think about **developer-centric AI tooling**. From solving OAuth headaches to shaping batch processing strategies, it acted as my **technical mentor, brainstorming partner, and code debugger** throughout.

Instead of wasting time context-switching, I stayed **focused, creative, and fast**.

**Without Q Developer, this project would have taken double the time and lacked the polish it now has.**

## 🙌 **Thank You, Amazon Q Developer Team!**

This challenge was not just about code — it was about learning to build smarter, more thoughtful developer tools.
Q Developer made that learning enjoyable.
